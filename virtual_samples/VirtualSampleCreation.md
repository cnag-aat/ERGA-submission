If the RNA/DNA has been pooled before sequencing, you need to create a
virtual sample composed of all the different samples that were pooled.
For this, you need to edit the **Checklist_ENA-virtual_sample.tsv** file. The
information currently there corrsponds to the qqGluDors example, so
you\'ll need to replace the different fields with the correct
information for your genome.

Once you have completed the tsv file, you need to login in the Webin
page and do the submission of the tsv file as shown in the following
